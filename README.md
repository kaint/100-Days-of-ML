 ## Day6
     Today i  applied all the  concepts of CNN  on MNIST dataset using TensorFlow 
     and decide the different units in convolution layer and hidden layer
 ## Day7
     I studied the concept of Recurrent Neural Network and prepare the data from airline dataset
     and implement it using keras
 ## Day8 
     KNN  -: I studied KNN and implemented it on Iris Plants data set to predict different type of Plants and tried on different distance                finding mehod                like  Euclidian and manhattan distance and set the tweak the different value of K neigbours and               at the end i was able to find              100% testing score
